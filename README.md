# Tab Glutton

Chrome extension that helps you manage and navigate the growing number of tabs in your browser.

Tab Glutton is here to help you sift through the open tabs in your browser.  It supports filtering open tabs by the tab's title or URL.  Once you find the tab you're looking for, you can click on the entry to go directly to that tab.
